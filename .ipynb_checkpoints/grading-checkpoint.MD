# Grading

Thanks for a really well written and interesting final assignment! :) It was a pleasure to read, and it was really interesting to see the analyses for Helsinki neighborhoods.

**The good:**

- Really clear well constructed report, easy to follow
- You have good skills to utilize programming to your own research questions, excellent!
- Excellent documentation, including docstrings 
- Good visualizations!

**Something to improve still**:

- You could have splitted your functions into smaller chunks which makes the program even easier to maintain, understand and develop further. A good guideline is that "in principle" a function should only do one single thing (which makes it easy to also test its functioning --> testing was not covered here but crucial for software development)
- As you had the functions already in the urban_indicators.py file, you could have imported them and used from the Notebook which is again a good practice. You probably wanted to include the pieces in the notebook for purpose, so this is not a mistake by any mean.

### What does it take to get the best grade?

`Urban indicator` assignments and own custom assignments are evaluated individually and the grade is based on the merits of the work. For getting the best possible grade from the final work, following things are considered:

 - Are functions used in the code?
 - Is there good documentation of the tools (docstrings, comments etc) and a written report?
 - Does the work demonstrate well how the analyses were done / tools are used?
 - Are there visualizations? At least a single map should be in place, after all, this is a GIS course.
 - Is the code written in modular way e.g. writing functions into separate script (or start of the script) and importing/using them?
 - Is the extent of the work sufficient? 
    - There is no clear rule what is "sufficient", but considering the fact that final assignment replaces an exam, the final work needs to have merits and demonstrate the skills that have been learned during the course. Hence, a "shorter" work with stylish code and good programming practices can be as good (or better) than a longer report with simple analyses / "unsophisticated" programming practices.

All of these do not need to be in place, but these are used as guidance for grading.

## Grades

- Grade for final assignment 5/5.
- Grade for the exercises: 5/5
- Total grade for the course: **5/5**

Excellent work, throughout the course. Keep up the good work also in the future! Thanks for participating! :)
